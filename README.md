# facebook-rest-client
Here is my implementation of facebook rest client. 
In this project i used Spring Boot with Java and Spock with Groovy for tests.
If you want to build project, run app or run tests you can use gradle which is provied.
Clone the repository, run ./gradlew bootRun and have fun :)
